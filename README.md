# Simple Bank System Simulation

This is a console application written in C++ that simulates a simple bank system. It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and text files for data storage instead of a database.

- **Security Features**: The system users security measures such as encryption for sensitive data (e.g., passwords).

- **Administrative Controls**: Administrators have additional privileges such as managing user accounts, viewing system logs, and more.
